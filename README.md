# AI Personality Insights ✨

A Next.js application that analyzes personality traits and provides personalized insights using multiple AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini).

## Value 🌟

This project serves as a learning playground for exploring LangChain integration with various Large Language Models (LLMs). By implementing personality analysis features, it creates a reusable boilerplate that demonstrates how to effectively orchestrate multiple AI models (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini) through LangChain's unified interface. The codebase structure and patterns established here can be easily adapted for future LangChain-powered applications.
